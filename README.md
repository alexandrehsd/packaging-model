# packaging-model
This repository serves the educational purpose for learning how to package an ML model.

Here, we will use an ONNX model and package it within a container that serves a Flask app that performs the prediction. We will use the [RoBERTa-SequenceClassification](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/text/machine_comprehension/roberta) ONNX model, which is very well documented.
